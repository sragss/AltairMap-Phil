# Running this shit
- You'll need `python3`, `altair` and `pandas`
- The latter two should be installed through pip, good luck with that
- run with `python3 map.py`
- altair is the plotting framework
- all details on changing the map are done by googling `altair + <something I want to know about altair>`
